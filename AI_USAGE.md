# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

# AI Usage Report

I used AI as a collaborator. I asked it to explain unclear requirements and help navigate complex parts of the project.

It helped fix errors in my code and suggested improvements (for example, replacing `findAll` with more efficient queries). I did not always agree with its suggestions (e.g., regarding the queue logic).

Overall, I always ensure I understand the code rather than just copying it.
